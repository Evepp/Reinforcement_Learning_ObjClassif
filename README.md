# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Object Classification with Blurred Images 

This is a repository for my thesis research which its purpose is basically to use a Deep Reinforcement Learning architecture for object classification on blurred images. Please read into more detail README file. 


With this project I try to make posible that the accuracy of the object classification improves even was trained in clear images but for the test is faced with blurred motion images.
