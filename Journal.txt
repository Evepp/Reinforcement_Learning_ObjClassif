- March, 22: I just charged the dataset of 5 objects in my dataset and created the repository I think
    - the next step is to create the algorithm for charge the data to google collab and then 
    - generate labels 
    - split data 
    - take the test data and split again 
    - and use the test subset data to blurr the images 
    - then try to do a CNN or sth
